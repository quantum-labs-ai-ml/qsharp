//! The [`ValidWordCollector`] provides a mechanism to hook into the parser
//! to collect the possible valid words at a specific cursor location in the
//! code. It's meant to be used by the code completion feature in the
//! language service.
//!
//! Any time the parser is about to try parsing a word token, it records the
//! expected word(s) through a call to [`ValidWordCollector::expect()`].
//! These are considered to be valid words for that location.
//!
//! If the parser is not at the cursor position yet, this call is ignored.
//!
//! Once the parser has reached the cursor position, the expected word(s)
//! are recorded into a list.
//!
//! At this point, the [`ValidWordCollector`] tricks the parser by
//! intercepting the lexer and returning an EOF token to the parser instead
//! of the real next token from the source.
//!
//! Since EOF will never match a token that the parser is looking for, this
//! causes the parser to keep trying all possible tokens at at this location,
//! recording the expected words in the process. Finally, it gives up.
//!
//! As soon as the parser reports a parse error at the cursor location,
//! the [`ValidWordCollector`] stops recording expected words. This
//! is to prevent the word list from getting polluted with words that are
//! expected after recovery occurs.
//!
//! For example, consider the code sample below, where `|` denotes the
//! cursor location:
//!
//! ```qsharp
//! operation Main() : Unit { let x: |
//! ```
//!
//! When the parser gets to the cursor location, it looks for the words that are
//! applicable at a type position (paths, type parameters, etc). But it
//! keeps finding the EOF that was inserted by the [`ValidWordCollector`].As the
//! parser goes through each possible word, the word is recorded by the collector.
//! Finally, the parser gives up and reports a parse error. The parser then recovers,
//! and and starts looking for words that can start statements instead (`let`, etc).
//! These words are *not* recorded by the collector since they occur
//! after the parser has already reported an error.
//!
//! Note that returning EOF at the cursor means that the "manipulated"
//! parser will never run further than the cursor location, meaning the two
//! below code inputs are equivalent:
//!
//! ```qsharp
//! operation Foo() : | Unit {}
//! ```
//!
//! ```qsharp
//! operation Foo() : |
//! ```
